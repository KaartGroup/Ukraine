### Scope of Editing
The main focus is to corrects ways with potential connectivity issues. These are ways with nodes that are closer than two meters, but not connected. The scope of this project focuses on road connectivity, but editors will also address the general integrity of the data in the areas edited.

### Validation
Editors will use the JOSM validation tool to correct [errors and warnings](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Validator#Validations) that existed prior to the editing process, or may have been created during. The contributor will run this validation and fix any errors or warnings prior to any changes being uploaded.
