## Tasking Manager
The Kaart team will work to improve data that impacts routing and the overall road network in <COUNTRY>.

### Scope of Editing
The main focus is to correct data that can be problematic for routing. In some cases the data is floating and not connected to the greater network. Other issues may be caused by a oneway into an area without an option to route back out. In all cases, one would not be able to route back out of an area. Additionally, editors will address the general integrity of the data in the areas edited.

### Validation
Editors will use the JOSM validation tool to correct [errors and warnings](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/JOSM/Validator#Validations) that existed prior to the editing process, or may have been created during. The contributor will run this validation and fix any errors or warnings prior to any changes being uploaded.
