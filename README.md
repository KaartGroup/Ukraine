## Projects

### [Road Network Improvement Project](https://github.com/KaartGroup/Ukraine/projects/1 "Project 1")
Using GIS analysis tools, we identified areas where we believe there are missing roads. The purpose of this project is to digitize missing roads in those areas and ensure a high quality road network.

#### Contributors
The project is open to OpenStreetMap contributors of any experience level.
